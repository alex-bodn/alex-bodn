### Welcome to my GitHub 👋 I'm Alex
<p>I've been involved in software development for the past 3 years — starting with scripts and utility tools, and gradually shifting toward more complex projects. Lately, I've been deeply focused on frontend development, with particular interest in building fast, accessible, and maintainable user interfaces.</p>
